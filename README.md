# Comparison of HTML to PDF conversion tools

This is a collection of tools used to make [this blog post](https://peterdev.pl/2019/01/11/picking-a-php-tool-to-generate-pdfs/).

The purpose is to put the same HTML document through different PDF generators and compare the results.
I'm looking at layout errors, font embedding, output file size, and so on.

Currently supported tools:
* [Dompdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf)
* [mPDF](https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf)
* [TCPDF](https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF)
* [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/)
